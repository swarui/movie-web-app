## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.

---

- Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)

- Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

- Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

- Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

- Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
